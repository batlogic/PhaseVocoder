# PhaseVocoder
A C++ based phase vocoder example that allows pitch and timescale modifications of incoming signals. UI built with Juce.

The plan is modernize the code base with current best practices, both C++ and Juce wise. 
Ideally I'd like to extend the algorithms to use higher quality phase locking algorithms for improved sound quality.
Include more effects than just pitch and timescale modifications.
Basically an spectral effect tool would be the end goal.
